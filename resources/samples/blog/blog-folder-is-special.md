# The Blog Folder is Special

CATEGORIES(introduction)

The blog folder has some special behaviors that make it easier to organize content in a more blog-like fashion, such as organized categories, auto-generated folders for each category, and default HAML templates and partials so you can render the blog differently from other pages.

By default, it is called `blog`, but you can customize this in in `yuzu.yml`. Currently, a yuzu site can only contain one blog folder, but this may change in the future.
