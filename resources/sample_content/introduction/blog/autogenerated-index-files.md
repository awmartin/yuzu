# Autogenerated index.html files

CATEGORY(features)

You'll notice that the blog folder doesn't have an `index.md` file. That's Yuzu creates one automatically for all folders without a file named `index`. This consists of a single `INSERTCATALOG` directive that grabs all the content files in the folder and renders then with the `_block.haml` folder by default.
