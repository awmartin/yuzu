# About Yuzu

Yuzu is a blog-aware, extensible, static-website generator and publisher that builds an HTML5 website from a folder of text files and images.

This is one of the sample websites that comes with Yuzu. If you're new to using Yuzu, I recommend that you browse this site in parallel with the site's source. Although Yuzu behaves like many other static website generators, it has some unique features that are revealed in the docs and this site.


## Development

Yuzu is under development, so naturally some features may not work the way they're intended. If you find a bug, have an idea for a feature, or would like to contribute to development, please get in touch with me at the project's [Github page](http://github.com/awmartin/yuzu).


## Getting Started

See the post on [Getting Started](LINKROOT/getting-started.html) for instructions on creating a Yuzu project.
