# ChangeLog

2013-02-09     William Martin <william.martin@anomalus.com>

Major refactoring work to update the project. It's a shame that I didn't keep this change under more fine-grained source control, but it was such a drastic re-architecting that it seemed ok to get the infrastructure in place then add features and bugfixes later.

* Version bump to 0.2.0.
